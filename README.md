# INSTALLATION AND GUIDE

# requirements
Python version 2.* NB// The project is currently not compatibal with future python version
** I recomend using a Virtual Environment
   
1. Git clone/ download and unzip the project into the directory of your choice

2. On the project's root directory

          $ makevirtualenv microfinance       # creates a virtual environment
          $ source microfinace/bin/activate        # start the virtual environment
          $ pip install requirements.txt      # download and install project's dependancies
          $ python manage.py runserver        # starts project

You would want to tunnel yor connection through Ngrok, for sandboxing purposes.

   Head over to the virtual environment and Ngrok sites to learn more about using the tools
